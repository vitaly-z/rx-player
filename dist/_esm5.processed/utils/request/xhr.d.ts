/**
 * # request function
 *
 * Translate GET requests into Rx.js Observables.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * Perform the request on subscription.
 * Emit zero, one or more progress event(s) and then the data if the request
 * was successful.
 *
 * Throw if an error happened or if the status code is not in the 200 range at
 * the time of the response.
 * Complete after emitting the data.
 * Abort the xhr on unsubscription.
 *
 * ## Emitted Objects
 *
 * The emitted objects are under the following form:
 * ```
 *   {
 *     type {string}: the type of event
 *     value {Object}: the event value
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * The type of event can either be "progress" or "data-loaded". The value is
 * under a different form depending on the type.
 *
 * For "progress" events, the value should be the following object:
 * ```
 *   {
 *     url {string}: url on which the request is being done
 *     sendingTime {Number}: timestamp at which the request was sent.
 *     currentTime {Number}: timestamp at which the progress event was
 *                           triggered
 *     size {Number}: current size downloaded, in bytes (without
 *                          overhead)
 *     totalSize {Number|undefined}: total size to download, in bytes
 *                                   (without overhead)
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * For "data-loaded" events, the value should be the following object:
 * ```
 *   {
 *     status {Number}: xhr status code
 *     url {string}: URL on which the request was done (can be different than
 *                   the one given in arguments when we go through
 *                   redirections).
 *     responseType {string}: the responseType of the request
 *                            (e.g. "json", "document"...).
 *     sendingTime {Number}: time at which the request was sent, in ms.
 *     receivedTime {Number}: timest at which the response was received, in ms.
 *     size {Number}: size of the received data, in bytes.
 *     responseData {*}: Data in the response. Format depends on the
 *                       responseType.
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * For any successful request you should have 0+ "progress" events and 1
 * "data-loaded" event.
 *
 * For failing request, you should have 0+ "progress" events and 0 "data-loaded"
 * event (the Observable will throw before).
 *
 * ## Errors
 *
 * Several errors can be emitted (the Rx.js way). Namely:
 *   - RequestErrorTypes.TIMEOUT_ERROR: the request timeouted (took too long to
 *     respond).
 *   - RequestErrorTypes.PARSE_ERROR: the browser APIs used to parse the
 *                                    data failed.
 *   - RequestErrorTypes.ERROR_HTTP_CODE: the HTTP code at the time of reception
 *                                        was not in the 200-299 (included)
 *                                        range.
 *   - RequestErrorTypes.ERROR_EVENT: The XHR had an error event before the
 *                                    response could be fetched.
 * @param {Object} options
 * @returns {Observable}
