import SegmentInventory from "../inventory";
/**
 * Class allowing to push segments and remove data to a buffer to be able
 * to decode them in the future as well as retrieving information about which
 * segments have already been pushed.
 *
 * A `SegmentBuffer` can rely on a browser's SourceBuffer as well as being
 * entirely defined in the code.
 *
 * A SegmentBuffer is associated to a given "bufferType" (e.g. "audio",
 * "video", "text") and allows to push segments as well as removing part of
 * already-pushed segments for that type.
 *
 * Because a segment can be divided into multiple chunks, one should call the
 * `endOfSegment` method once all chunks of a given segment have been pushed
 * (through the `pushChunk` method) to validate that a segment has been
 * completely pushed.
 * It is expected to push chunks from only one segment at a time before calling
 * the `endOfSegment` function for that segment. Pushing chunks from multiple
 * segments in parallel could have unexpected result depending on the underlying
 * implementation.
 * TODO reflect that in the API?
 *
 * A SegmentBuffer also maintains an "inventory", which is the current
 * list of segments contained in the underlying buffer.
 * This inventory has to be manually "synchronized" (through the
 * `synchronizeInventory` method) before being retrieved (through the
 * `getInventory` method).
 *
 * Also depending on the underlying implementation, the various operations
 * performed on a `SegmentBuffer` (push/remove/endOfSegment) can happen
 * synchronously or asynchronously.
 * In the latter case, such operations are put in a FIFO Queue.
 * You can retrieve the current queue of operations by calling the
 * `getPendingOperations` method.
 * If operations happens synchronously, this method will just return an empty
 * array.
