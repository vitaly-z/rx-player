     * As an example, to reset the speed to "normal" (x1) speed and to disable
     * trickMode video tracks (which may have been enabled by a previous
     * `setPlaybackRate` call), you can call:

     * fast forward/rewind feature, by only displaying a few video frames during
     * playback.
     *
     * This behavior is configurable through the second argument, by adding a
     * property named `preferTrickModeTracks` to that object.
     *
     * You can set that value to `true` to switch to trickMode video tracks when
     * available, and set it to `false` when you want to disable that logic.
     * Note that like any configuration given to `setPlaybackRate`, this setting
     * is persisted through all future contents played by the player.
     *
     * If you want to stop enabling trickMode tracks, you will have to call
     * `setPlaybackRate` again with `preferTrickModeTracks` set to `false`.
     *
     * You can know at any moment whether this behavior is enabled by calling
     * the `areTrickModeTracksEnabled` method. This will only means that the
     * RxPlayer will select in priority trickmode video tracks, not that the
     * currently chosen video tracks is a trickmode track (for example, some
     * contents may have no trickmode tracks available).
     *
     * If you want to know about the latter instead, you can call `getVideoTrack`
     * and/or listen to `videoTrackChange` events. The track returned may have an
     * `isTrickModeTrack` property set to `true`, indicating that it is a
     * trickmode track.
     *
     * Note that switching to or getting out of a trickmode video track may
     * lead to the player being a brief instant in a `"RELOADING"` state (notified
     * through `playerStateChange` events and the `getPlayerState` method). When in
     * that state, a black screen may be displayed and multiple RxPlayer APIs will
     * not be usable.
