import { Observable } from "rxjs";
/**
 * Create Observables which can be priorized between one another.
 *
 * With this class, you can link an Observables to a priority number.
 * The lower this number is, the more priority the resulting Observable will
 * have.
 *
 * Such returned Observables - called "tasks" - will then basically wait for
 * pending task with more priority (i.e. a lower priority number) to finish
 * before "starting".
 *
 * This only applies for non-pending tasks. For pending tasks, those are usually
 * not interrupted except in the following case:
 *
 * When a task with a "high priority" (which is a configurable priority
 * value) is created, pending tasks with a "low priority" (also configurable)
 * will be interrupted. Those tasks will be restarted when all tasks with a
 * higher priority are finished.
 *
 * You can also update the priority of an already-created task.
 *
 * ```js
 * const observable1 = Observable.timer(100).pipe(mapTo(1));
 * const observable2 = Observable.timer(100).pipe(mapTo(2));
 * const observable3 = Observable.timer(100).pipe(mapTo(3));
 * const observable4 = Observable.timer(100).pipe(mapTo(4));
 * const observable5 = Observable.timer(100).pipe(mapTo(5));
 *
 * // Instanciate ObservablePrioritizer.
 * // Also provide a `high` priority step - the maximum priority number a "high
 * // priority task" has and a `low` priority step - the minimum priority number
 * // a "low priority task" has.
 * const prioritizer = new ObservablePrioritizer({
 *   prioritySteps: { high: 0, low: 20 }
 * });
 *
 * const pObservable1 = prioritizer.create(observable1, 4);
 * const pObservable2 = prioritizer.create(observable2, 2);
 * const pObservable3 = prioritizer.create(observable3, 1);
 * const pObservable4 = prioritizer.create(observable4, 3);
 * const pObservable5 = prioritizer.create(observable5, 2);
 *
 * // start every Observables at the same time
 * observableMerge(
 *   pObservable1,
 *   pObservable2,
 *   pObservable3,
 *   pObservable4,
 *   pObservable5
 * ).subscribe((evt) => {
 *   if (evt.type === "data") {
 *     console.log(i);
 *
 *     // To spice things up, update pObservable1 priority to go before
 *     // pObservable4
 *     if (i === 5) { // if pObservable5 is currently emitting
 *       prioritizer.updatePriority(pObservable1, 1);
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * // Result:
 * // 3
 * // 2
 * // 5
 * // 1
 * // 4
 *
 * // Note: here "1" goes before "4" only because the former's priority has been
 * // updated before the latter was started.
 * // It would be the other way around if not.
 * ```
