# Deprecated APIs

This documentation lists APIs deprecated in the v3.x.x.

As we guarantee API compatibility in the v3.x.x, those API won't disappear until
we switch to a v4.x.x version.

You will find here which APIs are deprecated, why, and depending on the
concerned API, how to replace it.

### keySystems[].throwOnLicenseExpiration

The `throwOnLicenseExpiration` property of the `keySystems` option has been
replaced by the more powerful `onKeyExpiration` property.

#### How to replace that option

If you set `throwOnLicenseExpiration` to `false` before, you can simply set
`onKeyExpiration` to `"continue"` instead, which reproduce the exact same
behavior:
```ts
// old way
rxPlayer.loadVideo({
  // ...
  keySystems: [
    {
      throwOnLicenseExpiration: false,
      // ...
    }
  ],
});

// new way
rxPlayer.loadVideo({
  // ...
  keySystems: [
    {
      onKeyExpiration: "continue",
      // ...
    }
  ],
});
```

You can have more information on the `onKeyExpiration` option [in the
correspnding API documentation](./Decryption_Options.md#onkeyexpiration).

If you previously set `throwOnLicenseExpiration` to `true` or `undefined`, you
can just remove this property as this still the default behavior.


## Other properties

Some very specific properties from various methods are deprecated.
You will find them here.

### Smooth

Setting a `*.wsx`, a `*.ism` or a `*.isml` URL as an `url` property in
`loadVideo` is now deprecated when we're talking about a Smooth Streaming
content.

We recommend to only set a Manifest URL in that property when the transport is
equal to `smooth`.
